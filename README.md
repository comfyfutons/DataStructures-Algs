DataStructures-Algs
===================
Goal: To attempt to create a data structures database with simplified examples of many problems

Description: As I reach the end of my college experience I realised I need to brush up on different data structures and algorithms not only as a way to prepare for interviewing and the job world but to better my problem solving skills. This will hopefully speed up future projects as well as allow me quick access to simplified examples or shells of many data structures and algorithms.
